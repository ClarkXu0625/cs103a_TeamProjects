<section>I've written the chatGPT.js file, GPT.js in model and two generate-paragraph in view.
    <br>I've also helped solving the problem that the python code of openai is not working in js
    <br>environment. Changed the config.js to accept variables from the os.

<section>I have written /routes/chatGPT2 and ejs pages in /views/chat2. 
    <br> Get response function in /routes/chatGPT2 was build based on John's code.
    <br> Different from generate-paragraph, my route page allows user to customize
    <br> their prompt. User can also ask questions to ChatGPT by leaving prompt empty.
    <br> I also organized chat history into a separate page from chat page. Additionally,
    <br> I organized the unique prompts into a separated page, and user can access 
    <br> chat history by prompt. Finally, I wrote the index, about, and team page.
